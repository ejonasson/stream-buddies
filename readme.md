# Stream Buddies

Stream buddies is a website that makes it easy for you to share who you're following on Twitch with your friends. Simply follow people you like on Twitch and they'll show up on your customized StreamBuddies page.

## Current Status:
Pre-Launch Development. Features core to the basic functionality of the site are not yet complete.

## Current Features

* Load the streams you follow onto one page.
* Filter by Offline/Online
* Constantly update as new streamers come online - no need to refresh
* Enter your username into a query string to go to your page (eg: streambuddies.com/index.html?name="YOURTWITCHNAME HERE")
* Add a search box to make it easy to get to your page
* Streams move from online to offline and vice versa

## Features Planned for Release

* Replace query string with forwarding to subdirectory (eg ?name="SpartanERK" becomes /SpartanERK)

## Features Planned for Post-Release

* Twitch Account integration. Ability to just hit "log in with Twitch" and have the rest done for you.
* Actual user system/database
* Let people add streams to their StreamBuddies page without following on twitch
* Let people set a "Featured Streamer List"
* Incorporate your own stream into current page.
