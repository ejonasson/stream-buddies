# Stream Buddies

Stream buddies is a website that makes it easy for you to share who you're following on Twitch with your friends. Simply follow people you like on Twitch and they'll show up on your customized StreamBuddies page.

## Current Status:

**Note that work on this project has (temporarily) been moved to a private repository. If you're looking for the most recent code, contact [SpartanERK](http://twitter.com/spartanERK) on Twitter.**

Soft Launch Development. Features core to the basic functionality of the site are complete, but not refined.

## Current Features

* Load the streams you follow onto one page.
* Filter by Offline/Online
* Constantly update as new streamers come online - no need to refresh
* Enter your username into a query string to go to your page (eg: streambuddies.com/index.html?name="YOURTWITCHNAME HERE")
* Search box to make it easy to get to your page

## Features Planned for Next Release

* Replace query string with forwarding to subdirectory (eg ?name="SpartanERK" becomes /SpartanERK)
* Save the user's stream with a cookie


## Features Planned for Future Release

* Twitch Account integration. Ability to just hit "log in with Twitch" and have the rest done for you.
* Actual user system/database
* Let people add streams to their StreamBuddies page without following on twitch
* Set a "Featured Streamer List"
* Incorporate your own stream into current page.
